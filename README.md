# Polygon Validator Infrastructure

Setting up a Polygon validator and data node on AWS using Terraform to explore blockchain infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Goals
Explore blockchain infrastructure by building a production-ready Polygon validator setup, learning the technical components and operational challenges of running blockchain nodes.

## ✅ Completed Infrastructure
- **AWS EC2 Instance**: t3.medium with proper security configuration
- **Terraform IaC**: Complete infrastructure as code setup
- **SSH Access**: Secure key-based authentication with generated key pairs
- **Security Groups**: Properly configured network access (SSH port 22)
- **Git Repository**: Professional project structure with .gitignore
- **Amazon Linux 2023**: Updated OS with newer glibc support

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS EC2
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Blockchain**: Polygon Bor + Heimdall clients
- **Operating System**: Amazon Linux 2023
- **Development**: Go 1.24.4 (latest), Git, Development Tools
- **Languages**: Go, Bash scripting, HCL (Terraform)

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Solutions

### GLIBC Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: Polygon Bor pre-built RPM packages require GLIBC 2.32+ but Amazon Linux 2 only has GLIBC 2.26.

**Error Encountered**: 
```bash
error: Failed dependencies:
    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.32)(64bit) is needed by bor-v1.5.5-1.x86_64
    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.34)(64bit) is needed by bor-v1.5.5-1.x86_64
    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.38)(64bit) is needed by bor-v1.5.5-1.x86_64
```

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. ❌ **Amazon Linux 2** (GLIBC 2.26) - Too old for modern Polygon packages
2. ⚠️ **Amazon Linux 2023** (GLIBC 2.34) - Partially compatible but still missing GLIBC 2.38
3. ✅ **Build from source** - Bypasses pre-built package dependencies entirely

**Resolution**: Updated Terraform AMI from Amazon Linux 2 to Amazon Linux 2023, then built Polygon Bor from source code to avoid glibc dependency conflicts.

**Key Lesson**: Always verify system library compatibility before deploying pre-built blockchain node packages. Modern blockchain clients often require newer system libraries than standard cloud AMIs provide. **Solution**: Build from source to bypass dependency conflicts.

## 🎉 Major Milestone Achieved

**Successfully built complete Polygon node infrastructure from source!**

Both core components are now operational:
- **Bor v1.5.5**: 114MB binary built from source, fully functional
- **Heimdall v1.0.7**: Both `heimdalld` and `heimdallcli` built and verified

This demonstrates advanced blockchain infrastructure skills including dependency resolution, source compilation, and system troubleshooting.

## 🔄 Architecture Overview
- **Bor Layer**: Block production (Go-Ethereum fork)
- **Heimdall Layer**: Proof-of-Stake consensus (Tendermint fork)
- **Ethereum Layer**: Smart contracts for staking and checkpoints

**Node Types**:
- **Sentry Node**: Public-facing node that connects to network peers
- **Validator Node**: Private node that connects only to sentry nodes
- **Full Node**: Stores complete blockchain history and validates transactions
